# SwapiApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.  You will need NPM and Angular CLI installed in order run the commands listed here. 

## Starting the App within a Development Container

#### First install all of the dependencies with `npm`
```
npm install
```

#### Then run one of these two options: 
```
npm start
ng serve 
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

You can add components, or other Angular objects using cli commands. This is helpful, because it injects almost all of the neccessary entries into your Module, and adds the code to the appropriate place in the file system so that you can reference the new element in other parts of your application. 

#### For example, to add a component run this command: 
  ```
  ng generate component component-name
  ``` 
  
#### Here are more commands for things you might want to generate:  
  ```ng generate directive directive-name
  ng generate pipe pipe-name
  ng generate service service-name
  ng generate class class-name
  ng generate module module-name
  ```
